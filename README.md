# Consultation Aggregator

The Consultation Aggregator helps get consultations from the Dublin's councils
consultation hubs into a Trello to help track, triage and share responses.

This was developed as a proof of concept for the
[Dublin Cycling Campaign](https://www.dublincycling.com) Infrastructure group.
